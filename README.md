# FileUploadAPI
Springboot-REST App to upload file

It is basic app that receives the uploaded file and saves it to a target directory.

The application can be accessed using the following URLs 

Upload Page:                         http://server:port/welcome     and 
List of files in the directory:      http://server:port/lookupFiles


Need to give a valid destination/target directory path in the service class for the application to run without error.
